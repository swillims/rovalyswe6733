# Rovaly-SWE6733
This was a project for SWE6733. There are several edits to the repo after the project was submitted. The main focus of the edits was removing junk files. There was a large .mp4 junk file that was increasing the load time of the project because it was being packaged with the website. Cleaning the project was required because I am going to need it functional if I include it in a portfolio. While I was editing the repo to clean it up I also discredited people who did 0 work on the project and removed filler space in the readme. https://github.com/swillims/rovalyswe6733/graphs/contributors most of these people should not be credited. 4/7 of the group members didn't even get to the login screen despite the project having cd pipeline and deployment since sprint 1 and a link to the website being posted several times. I'm not trying to complain but I am explaining my decision in not including them.

# Project Description
The project is pretty much a tinder clone. Instead of dates, it is for adventures such as hiking. Despite having about 3 weeks of dev time and nobody knowing dart, we managed to get most of the project done. The only feature we are missing is distance for filtering matches. In addition to missing distance, there is also a lot of cleaning that could have been done if we had more time. We could change the user verification to use firebase's verification. There is also a better way to navigate between widgets. The ui can be improved.
