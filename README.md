# Rovaly-SWE6733
This was a project for SWE6733. There are several edits to the repo after the project was submitted. The main focus of the edits was removing junk files. There was a large .mp4 junk file that was increasing the load time of the project because it was being packaged with the website. Cleaning the project was required because I am going to need it functional if I include it in a portfolio. I also adjusted credits to reflect who worked on the project. The creidt adjustment is mostly based on <a href="https://github.com/swillims/rovalyswe6733/graphs/contributors">this</a>. 4/7 of the group members did not get to the login screen despite the project having a cd pipeline and deployment since sprint 1 and a link to the website being posted in multiple places.

# Project Description
The project is pretty much a tinder clone. Instead of dates, it is for adventures such as hiking. The user can create accounts. The user can match with people with similar interests. The user can talk to and remove matches. Despite having about 3 weeks of dev time and nobody knowing Dart, we managed to get most of the project done. The only feature we are missing is distance for filtering matches. In addition to missing distance, there is also a lot of cleaning that could have been done if we had more time. We could change the user verification to use Firebase's verification. There is also a better way to navigate between widgets. The UI can be improved.
