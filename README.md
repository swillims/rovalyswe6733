# Rovaly-SWE6733
This was a project for SWE6733. There are several edits to the repo after the project was submitted. The main focus of the edits was removing junk files. There was a large .mp4 junk file that was increasing the load time of the project because it was being packaged with the website. Cleaning the project was required because I am going to need it functional if I include it in a portfolio. While I was editing the repo to clean it up to give credit to people who worked on the project. I also included people who made a contributions but nothing meaningful https://github.com/swillims/rovalyswe6733/graphs/contributors. 4/7 of the group members did notget to the login screen despite the project having a cd pipeline and deployment since sprint 1 and a link to the website being posted in multiple places.

# Project Description
The project is pretty much a tinder clone. Instead of dates, it is for adventures such as hiking. The user can create accounts. The user can match with people who have similar interests. The user can match with people with similar interests. The use can talk to and remove matches. Despite having about 3 weeks of dev time and nobody knowing dart, we managed to get most of the project done. The only feature we are missing is distance for filtering matches. In addition to missing distance, there is also a lot of cleaning that could have been done if we had more time. We could change the user verification to use firebase's verification. There is also a better way to navigate between widgets. The ui can be improved.
