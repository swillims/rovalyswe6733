# Rovaly-SWE6733
Project for SWE6733

## Group Name: White Clover
# Background:
Online dating is an enormous industry that grows each year. The findings of commissioned research concur with the periodic reports from top data aggregator firms of international repute. Reports reveal the revenue of top dating apps has almost doubled between 2017 and 2023. The number of online dating app users has also grown by nearly 80% in the past six years. As the audience for online dating has gotten bigger, the technology to meaningfully match different types of users has lagged behind. Oftentimes users, especially those looking for outdoor partners/adventurers to go explore a new place or activity, are matched using irrelevant metrics and statistics. Yes, users can use Bumble, OkCupid, or other apps, but theyâ€™re not adventure-specific, per se, to find like-minded partners for outdoor activities. As this has become commonplace, users find themselves matched with people who appear not to want the same thing, which may result in a lower-quality experience for all. That said, there is a shortage of creating a new outlet for finding adventure partners.
 
# Project Goal:
This team project aims to build an outdoor app (called Rovaly) for adventure seekers. Whether they're into hiking, kayaking, rock climbing, or just exploring new trails, the app matches them with like-minded adventurers who share their passion for the great outdoors. The app goes beyond basic metrics to ensure people find a partner who truly gets their love for adventure.
